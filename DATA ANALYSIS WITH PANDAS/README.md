## DATA ANALYSIS WITH PANDAS  :blush: :blush:


* [title](https://pandas.pydata.org/)*

* PANDAS is one of the most important item library .When we need to analyse data with python, PANDAS is one of the most widely used library.:heart_eyes:
* It is one of the most preferred and virally used tools in data analysis and also playing with data that are stored in CSV File (Comma Separated Values File), Text File and JSON file .
* This is one of the most important library which is currently used to perform operations over data.
* The major use of PANDAS is to be used for data manipulation ,analysis and cleaning.:heart_eyes:So, it is best suited for different kind of data in which we require some kind of manipulation or may be changing of data or maybe cleaning and removing unrequited data or maybe performing analysis.
* For performing different types of experiments with CSV , JSON , TEXT file and acquire the desired result using the PANDAS library.
* It is suitable for data that are stored in either tabular form or some ordered or unordered form or in may be some form of matrix or some form of unlabeled data.

---------------------------------------------------------------

* PANDAS IS A FAST, POWERFUL, FLEXIBLE AND EASY TO USE OPEN SOURCE DATA ANALYSIS AND MANIPULATION TOOL , WHICH IS BUILD ON THE TOP OF THE PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.IT IS AN EASY TO USE OPEN SOURCE LIBRARY PROVIDING HIGH-PERFORMANCE , EASY TO USE DATA STRUCTURES AND DATA ANALYSIS TOOLS FOR THE PYTHON PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE *

Here are a few things that pandas does well!! :sparkling_heart:ðŸ’– :sparkling_heart:
*  *Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data *
* * Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects*
* *Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations*
* *Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data*
* *Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects*
* *Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets*
* *Intuitive merging and joining data sets*
* *Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets*
* *Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)*
* *Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format*
* *Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging.*

#  PANDAS is abbreviated as Python Data Analysis Library
 *It is basically a library consisting up of multi-dimensional areas you can even consider it as multi-dimensional list, so that we can play with different types of processing formats *

 :heart_eyes::heart_eyes: Basically , PANDAS is a high level Library which uses other librarues too , inorder to work perfectly.
